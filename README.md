### What I learned

This project has taken my responsive navbar skills to the next level! Even though the final results are definitely not perfect (you can scroll while the navbar is open), I am still very proud of the evolution of both my skills and thought process when creating a collapsing navbar.

The project overall was not too complicated, but it was great practice with absolute positioning images, which in the past I've felt was an area I wasn't great at.
